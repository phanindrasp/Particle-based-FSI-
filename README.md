# Particle-based FSI model
A novel fluid-structure interaction(FSI) framework coupling smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) model for the fluid and constitutively informed particle dynamics (CPD) model for the solid. The model can easily handle solids with general constitutive relations as well as structural failures.
